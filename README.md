# Experimenting with Markdown (Heading 1)
Keep text lines left-aligned.
## Basic Syntax (Heading 2)
The following sections describe Markdown basic syntax.
### Typeface changes (Heading 3)
When necessary, use **bold** for emphasis.
Or, *italics*.
### Block quotes
To make a block quote, use the following syntax:
>I returned, and saw under the sun,
>That the race is not to the swift, 
>nor the battle to the strong, 
>neither yet bread to the wise, 
>nor yet riches to men of understanding, 
>nor yet favour to men of skill; 
>but time and chance happeneth to them all.
### Ordered Lists
1. Use numbers and periods.
2. Do not use the 1), 2) format.
3. Do not indent list items unless you want a nested list.
### Unordered Lists
- Use for items that are not prioritized.
- Other rules from "Ordered Lists" also apply here.

    Note that you can add indented text using a carriage return and four spaces.
### Images
Link to an image this way:

Note that it is a good idea to replace spaces in URLs with "%20%".

### Code
To denote text as code, surround it with backtick marks:
`print("hello world")`

### Escaping Characters
To escape a character, precede it with a backslash (\\):
>Use a backtick (\`) to surround code fragments.

### Horizontal Rules
To enter a horizontal rule line, use three or more of any one of the following:
- Asterisks
- Dashes
- Underscores  

For example:
> North
> ____
> South
